"""
Short-term motion extrapolation with an uncertainty cone that shrinks as
lead time decreases (i.e., the projection for "5 minutes from now" is much
tighter than "30 minutes from now") and tightens overall as more scans
confirm a stable motion vector.

This does NOT replace NWS tornado warning polygons, which incorporate
storm-scale NWP guidance, environmental shear/instability, and forecaster
judgment. This is pure trajectory extrapolation from observed radar motion —
useful for short lead times (0-15 min), unreliable beyond that.
